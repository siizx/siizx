- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrea, Italian, born in 1994.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in grappling, programming, human anatomy, music, working out, videogames and more...
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying computer science at UNIGE.

Yeah, i push commits often because i work from multiple machines during the day, and i also terribly fear data loss.
